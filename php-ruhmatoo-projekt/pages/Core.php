		<h2>Core</h2>
		
		<p>In common parlance, the core of the body is broadly considered to be the torso. Functional movements are highly dependent on this part of the body, and lack of core muscular development can result in a predisposition to injury.
			The major muscles of the core reside in the area of the belly and the mid and lower back (not the shoulders), and peripherally include the hips, 
			the shoulders and the neck.</p>

		<p> Major muscles included are the pelvic floor muscles, transversus abdominis, multifidus, internal and external obliques, rectus abdominis, 
			erector spinae (sacrospinalis) especially the longissimus thoracis, and the diaphragm. Minor core muscles include the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, and trapezius.</p>
