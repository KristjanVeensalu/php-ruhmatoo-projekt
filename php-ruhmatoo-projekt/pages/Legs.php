		<h2>Legs</h2>
		<p>The human leg, in the general sense, is the entire lower extremity or limb of the human body, including the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region. 
		However, the definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle 
		(called crus in Latin; the posterior of the crus is the sura).

		Legs are used for standing, walking, jumping, running, kicking, and dancing and similar activities, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. 
		Female legs generally have greater hip anteversion and tibiofemoral angles, but shorter femur and tibial lengths than those in males.

		<h2>Muscles</h2>

		<p>
		The anterior muscles, such as the quadriceps femoris, iliopsoas, and sartorius, work as a group to flex the thigh at the hip and extend the leg at the knee. 
		Posterior muscles, such as the hamstrings and gluteus maximus, produce the opposite motion – extension of the thigh at the hip and flexion of the leg at the knee. 
		Lateral muscles, such as the gluteus medius, abduct the thigh at the hip while the medial groin muscles adduct the thigh. 
		All of these muscle groups provide powerful contractions to propel the body while making fine adjustments to maintain the body’s posture and balance.

		Located inferior to the knee are a number of muscles that move the ankle, foot, and toes. 
		The calf muscles, including the gastrocnemius and soleus, join to form the strong calcaneal (Achilles) tendon of the heel and attach to the calcaneus bone in the heel. 
		These muscles contract to plantar flex the foot – such as when standing on your tiptoes – and flex the toes. 
		Shin muscles, such as the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus, dorsiflex the foot and extend the toes. 
		The muscles of the calf also work subtly to stabilize the ankle joint and foot and to maintain the body’s balance.
